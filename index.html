            Hey, I’m Navya. 
            This site is just a place where I keep bits of my life — 
            code I’ve written, projects I’ve started (and sometimes abandoned), 
            thoughts I don’t want to lose, and things I’m curious about. 
            I’m not trying to polish or package anything here. Some of it will make sense, 
            some of it won’t, but it’s all real. This is me, figuring things out as I go.
        </p>
    </div>
